  We moved to our home in Portland just before Thanksgiving weekend. We
  scheduled our PODS arrivals in conjunction with our Local muscle guys, and
  they were both on time, but worked with efficiency and intelligence. They were
  a joy to have around, if joy can be had when moving one's life possessions.
  What I mean to say is they were courteous, careful, and cheerful about the
  day. Great workers. I'd recommend them absolutely. And you know i"m telling
  you the truth, because I'm determined to not move again myself, any time soon.
  i.e. I have no motive other than to assist anyone considering hiring them.
