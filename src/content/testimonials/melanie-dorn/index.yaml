  Highly recommend Local Muscle. The movers showed up on time, were very
  friendly while being efficient. They dealt with the parking permits, which was
  a relief since both locations were tough parking situations. They asked me
  where I wanted the furniture and take really good care of antique furniture
  that I care a lot about. Love that it is a local company involved in the arts
  community too! I was slightly hesitant because it was in the high/mid-range of
  price quotes I received, but I went with them because of the good reviews.
  Really glad I did because the price ended up being the lowest estimated cost
  -- over all great experience so I wanted to make sure I left a review! They
  were also very COVID-conscious and wore masks the whole time, which I
  appreciated!
