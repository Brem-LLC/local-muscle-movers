      heading: Our story, in storage units
      description: >-
        No doubt we're well acquainted with storage units. Ten years ago our
        story started in one. Founding partner Alex Sargent got the idea to
        start a moving company after overhearing complaints about the moving
        experience and attitude of the movers people had hired. Ned Swain, a
        frequent customer, liked the idea so much he brought it to two other
        friends, Jake Holz and Jon Donnell. Soon after, Local Muscle was born
        with the driving idea that customer service and attitude of the crews
        will be what sets us apart. The results speak for themselves.
