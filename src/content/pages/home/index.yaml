        and the scope of their move to ensure we provide the right resources to

        move across town or a five bedroom house move out of state, we have you
        covered. Moving with Local Muscle is like moving with friends and that's
        why moving isn't just what we do for a living, it's what we live to do.

      review: >-
        We moved to our home in Portland just before Thanksgiving weekend. We
        scheduled our PODS arrivals in conjunction with our Local Muscle guys,
        and they were both on time, but worked with efficiency and intelligence.
        They were a joy to have around, if joy can be had when moving one's life
        possessions. What I mean to say is they were courteous, careful, and
        cheerful about the day. Great workers. I'd recommend them absolutely.
        And you know I'm telling you the truth, because I'm determined to not
        move again myself, any time soon. i.e. I have no motive other than to
        assist anyone considering hiring them.
