            The team of movers were courteous, friendly,  very helpful and moved
            along our house efficiently. This made our move quick and painless.
            Professionals from beginning to the end and were always responsive
            to any of our questions. They were a very nice group of guys and I
            would highly recommend Muscle Movers and I would definitely use them
            again!

            These are real professionals. The prep work was streamlined and
            easy. The rates were a good value. I had used them in 2021, and I
            had such a good experience that I made sure to use them again. They
            were just as good this time.


            This time we were moving from an apartment up one flight of stairs
            in downtown Portland to home in Cascoâ€¦they were able to handle both.
            Nothing got damaged. The movers were kind and professional.


            I highly recommend them.

            The Local Muscle team helped us moved our furniture and unload the
            contents of our PODs into our new home. They were punctual,
            efficient, and communicative, and made the whole process of moving
            so much less stressful. Throughout the whole process, they took
            excellent care of all of our belongings and were a delight to work
            with. If I ever need to move again, I would hire Local Muscle in a
            heartbeat. Highly recommend!!

            Very pleasant movers who were punctual and thorough. They were
            careful and went the extra mile.  I would definitely use them again
            and would  certainly recommend them to any one that is looking for a
            moving company.

            From start to finish we had a great experience. Communication was
            clear and timely, our movers showed up exactly when they predicted,
            and the estimate was spot on. The pair who came to move for us were
            conscientious, extremely polite, and so strong!

            These guys are awesome! They were prompt, efficient, SO nice and
            easy to work with and did a great job moving our stuff! Our total
            cost came in even lower than the estimate too which was an added
            bonus. We will definitely use them again if we move - highly
            recommend!

        We bill differently for interstate moves, as mandated by law. We will
        determine a flat rate and provide a quote, rather than create an
        hourly-based estimate.
